# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Vehicles

Welcome to this introductory guide on RL in autonomous systems! Whether you're a student, professional, or enthusiast, this resource is designed to give you a foundational understanding of what RL in autonomous systems is and how it function in the modern world.

If you're new to the field of Reinforcement Learning, this guide will provide you with a solid starting point, covering its key concepts and how it can be integrated in the real world. If you have an interest in robotics, artificial intelligence, engineering, and emerging technologies this will be serve as a useful resource to begin your journey in RL.

We hope this training will give you a deep understanding of the field, inspire curiosity, and prepare you to delve further into the world of autonomy.

> **No prior knowledge is required—just a curiosity about the future of intelligent systems.**

### Why should you study RL?🤖

Ok let's end this demonstration with an important question. why should you study RL in AV. we'll assume that most people reading this document are in **AI, mechatronics, computer science engineering** or any other field that is related to programming and software. so why should be interested in this field. one word for this which is **opportunities.**Specially Rl in Autonomous field is not as popular such as **embedded systems or web development** for example and that's because it's still developing and it's kinda hard and takes a good amount of time to get comfortable with. but if you there's no better time than now to start getting in the field.

### **Resources** 📚

To deepen your understanding and explore more about autonomous systems, here are some valuable resources:

[RL track on DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/reinforcement-learning) - I recommend to start with it as the next resources are more advanced

[DeepMind research lead David Silver's course on reinforcement learning, taught at University College London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0 ) 

[Reinforcement Learning An Introduction second edition Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703/textbook/BartoSutton.pdf) - book

- You should have very good foundations in Data Science specially in deep learning before studing Deep Reinforcement Learning which used in complex environment like Autonomous Vehicles
