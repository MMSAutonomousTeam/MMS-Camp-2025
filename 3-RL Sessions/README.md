# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Vehicles

Welcome to this introductory guide on **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** in autonomous systems!  
Whether you're a student, professional, or enthusiast, this resource is designed to give you a **foundation** in how RL is shaping the modern world.

If you're new to the field, this guide will serve as a **starting point** — covering the essentials and showing how RL connects with real-world applications.  
If you’re curious about robotics, AI, or emerging technologies, this is a great place to begin your journey.

This session is designed to **spark curiosity, build understanding, and open the door** to the world of autonomy.

> **No prior knowledge is required — just curiosity about the future of intelligent systems.**

### Kickoff Activity

To begin, let’s watch a couple of short videos that demonstrate how an agent learns through trial and error.  
Afterwards, we’ll discuss what patterns we noticed.

**Observation:** The robot tries many actions, fails often, but gradually learns the correct behavior after enough training time.

### 1 - What is Reinforcement Learning (RL)?

Reinforcement Learning is a way of teaching an **agent** through **trial and error**.  
If the agent takes a good action, it receives a **reward**. If it takes a wrong action, it receives a **penalty** (negative reward).

A simple example is how a baby learns to walk:  
At first, they fall many times, but with repeated attempts, they learn how to stand and eventually walk on their own.

This diagram shows how RL can be applied to **Autonomous Vehicles (AVs):**

- **Agent** → the learning robot (self-driving car)  
- **Environment** → everything around the car (roads, pedestrians, other cars, traffic lights, etc.)  
- **State** → the position/situation the car was in, is currently in, or will be in  
- **Action** → the decision the car makes that changes its state  
- **Reward** → motivation or feedback that pushes the agent to behave better  

👉 The goal of the agent is to **maximize its rewards** over time by learning better strategies.  
RL is especially powerful for **sequential decision-making**, since each new decision depends on the previous ones.

### Why should you study RL?🤖

Ok let's end this demonstration with an important question. why should you study RL in AV. we'll assume that most people reading this document are in **AI, mechatronics, computer science engineering** or any other field that is related to programming and software. so why should be interested in this field. one word for this which is **opportunities.**Specially Rl in Autonomous field is not as popular such as **embedded systems or web development** for example and that's because it's still developing and it's kinda hard and takes a good amount of time to get comfortable with. but if you there's no better time than now to start getting in the field.

### **Resources** 📚

To deepen your understanding and explore more about autonomous systems, here are some valuable resources:

[RL track on DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/reinforcement-learning) - I recommend to start with it as the next resources are more advanced

[DeepMind research lead David Silver's course on reinforcement learning, taught at University College London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0 ) 

[Reinforcement Learning An Introduction second edition Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703/textbook/BartoSutton.pdf) - book

- You should have very good foundations in Data Science specially in deep learning before studing Deep Reinforcement Learning which used in complex environment like Autonomous Vehicles
